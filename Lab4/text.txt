So long since I've seen her, she can feel a change in me.
Change, she could feel a change in me.
So long since I've seen her, she can feel a change in me.
...
Love comes with a price tag and a barcode.
Still love you when we part though.
Blame me like is'my fault.
Walk around like your heart could.
Hop around like your parkour.
